# BidWave Engine

BidWave is a spreadsheet-driven AV quoting + labor logic engine (Sheets + Forms).
This repo is the source-of-truth for:
- field maps (CSV exports)
- logic block specifications
- QC/test harness rules
- release notes and onboarding docs

Google Sheets = runtime
GitHub = versioned logic + documentation
